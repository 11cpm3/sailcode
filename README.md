Main repository.

Currently nothing is ready for production.

Building the file structure to match the specifications of the Arduino IDE.

Most code, for interfacing with hardware should be placed in a Library, see
[this tutorial](http://arduino.cc/en/Hacking/LibraryTutorial) for information
about writing a library for Arduino.

Note that the tutorial includes some C++ syntax, please avoid this for now, and
use the similar C syntax, such as structs rather than classes.
