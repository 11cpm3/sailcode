# Planning notes

Features of the command line to be imitated. The ability to scroll through a command history. Needs the ability to scroll through the get_line buffers. Will need to modify the get_line function to look for more than just newline characters. Might need the ability to set flags, erase the command buffer and immediately replace it with something else.

The ability to open up and monitor a serial line over the serial console. Should be registered as a user function.
